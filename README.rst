SyNAP Documentation
===================

The documentation is available at https://synaptics-synap.github.io/doc/

Building
--------

To build the documentation you need to clone the ``framework`` git repository along with this repository::

  $ git clone https://github.com/synaptics-astra/synap-framework.git -b ${VERSION} ../framework

where ``${VERSION}`` is an Astra version tag such as ``v1.0.0.``.

Once you cloned the ``framework`` repository you can launch the build with the following command::

  $ ./build.sh
